## Quickstart
On a fresh installation of Raspbian Stretch Lite, run the following command to install Docker, Docker Compose and all of the necessary images and configuration to run the Nido thermostat:

`$ curl -fsSL get-nido.moveolabs.com | source /dev/stdin`

Go make yourself a cup of coffee or a phone a friend you haven't spoken to in a while, because depending on the model and speed of your Raspberry Pi, the setup process will take at least 20 minutes.

Once Nido is up and running, you can add it as a new accessory in the Apple Home app using the default code `94812494`, or scan the QR code in the startup logs. Make sure your Apple device is on the same network as the Raspberry Pi.

Of course, you'll need some hardware to make the software useful, so keep reading...
